# An example for mergerfs + snapraid fstab entry
#
# First identify the disks you need with:
# ls /dev/disks/by-id (or by-uuid)
#
# Obviously make sure they are partitioned.
# Then decide which disks you want for storage vs parity.
# NB: The largest disk must be a parity drive.
#
# Mount each drive with its own fstab entry, and then combine them in a
# mergerfs pool.
#
# Example:
#
# /dev/disk/by-id/xyz1  /mnt/parity1 ext4 defaults 0 0
# /dev/disk/by-id/xyz2  /mnt/disk1   ext4 defaults 0 0
# /dev/disk/by-id/xyz3  /mnt/disk2   ext4 defaults 0 0
# /dev/disk/by-id/xyz4  /mnt/disk3   ext4 defaults 0 0
# /dev/disk/by-id/xyz5  /mnt/disk4   ext4 defaults 0 0
#
# /mnt/disk*            /mnt/storage fuse.mergerfs direct_io,defaults,allow_other,minfreespace=50G,fsname=mergerfs 0 0
#
# Then you can mount everything using 'mount -a'
#
# Don't forget to configure snapraid! An example file is included.
# After configuring, you can run it with 'snapraid sync'
#
# You should also add a cron entry for snapraid-runner, e.g.:
# 00 08 * * * python2 /opt/snapraid-runner/snapraid-runner.py -c /opt/snapraid-runner/snapraid-runner.conf
