# dotfiles

Repo for my dotfiles. This repo is undergoing significant changes. This is as a
result of:

- moving from bash to zsh + ohmyzsh
- moving from ViM to NeoViM
- moving from Chad.nvim to a full config from scratch using Lazy.nvim
- discovering how amazing Ansible is

I've done a lot of cleanup, and in the near future I plan on creating Ansible
playbooks for _everything_.
